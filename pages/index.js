        We stumbled upon a Yuga Labs Twitter account which had 20k followers and thought that it was the official account but when we visited the site that they mentioned in their description it was up for sale, we thought it would be a good chance to grab this domain and sell for profit in the future. We bought the domain and then we found that this was not the official Yuga Labs account.
